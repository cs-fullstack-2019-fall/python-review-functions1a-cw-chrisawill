### Problem 1
# Create a ```printNumbers``` function to print integers from -25 to 20 to the console (print in the function)

# def main(numbers):
#     x = -25
#     while x < 21:
#         print(x)
#         x+=1


# main("")

### Problem 2
# Create a function called checkPassword. Send two string variables to the checkPassword function to check if the strings are equal. Return true if they are equal and false if they are not equal. Print the function's return value.


#
# def main(checkPassword):
#     password = input("Please enter your password: ")
#     confirmPassword = input("Please confirm password: ")

#     if password == confirmPassword:
#         print("Correct password!")

#     elif confirmPassword != password:
#         print(f"{confirmPassword} is incorrect!")
#     return checkPassword

# main('')

# Write a function that determines if a number passed to it is odd or even. Pass a number of your choosing (using input a good idea) and then using the result from the function, print if the number was even or not.
#
# examples:
# ```
# The number 12 is an even number!
#
# The number 5 is an odd number!

# def main(numSorting):
#     numbers = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
#     if numbers%2 > 0:
#     	# !! : Return true if they are equal and false if they are not equal
#         print(f"The number {numbers} is an odd number.")
#     else:
#         print(f"The number {numbers} is an even number.")
            
# main('')

# * Create a function for the challenge that you call from your ```main```
# * Create a *second* function that takes NO parameters
# * Create a *third* function that takes a single greeting parameter (ex. ```Howdy```) and returns a string using the passed in greeting and 'World' (ex. ```Howdy World!```)
# * From your *first* function, call the function(s) and print out the final result returned

# def main(challenge):

#     empty()
# def empty():
# 	# !! : this could really easily be user input instead of hard coded
#     greeting("Howdy")
# def greeting(challange):
#     print(challange, "partner!")

# main(f"{greeting}")

# Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’. If the user doesn't enter 'q', ask them to input another string.

# def main():
#     stop = input("press q to quit:")
#     # !! : Create a function that has a loop that quits with ‘q’
#     if stop != "q":
#         print("press q")
#     else:
#         print("thanks")

# main()
